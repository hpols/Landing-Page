## About

Based on the provided starter project, which has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project, I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. All changes are made in the JavaScript file: `js/app.js`.

For more info see Udacity Classroom for FEND.

## Functionality

* The Javascript loads the Sections into the Navigation bar
* When clicking on an item in the navigation bar the page scrolls to the selected section
* Whichever section is visible on screen is highlighted by a darker background
* The navigation bar is hidden after a few seconds of not-scrolling
